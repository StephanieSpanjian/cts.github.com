The Google Map CTS Widget helps you include a simple Google Map on your website
withoiut any JavaScript. You can add pins, and if you want, custom markers and
popup windows. 

To start, you'll need to add two lines of code to the `HEAD` section of your
HTML page. This is the part between the `<head>....</head>` tags toward the
beginning of the document.
