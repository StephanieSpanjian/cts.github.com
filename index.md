Hello!

Cascading Tree Sheets (CATS) are a new way to describe how data and HTML
structure interact on the web. On the surface, it is tempting to call this
*templating* but CATS can to much more.

Look left for some examples, and please email me (Ted Benson &lt;<a
href="mailto:eob@csail.mit.edu">eob@csail.mit.edu</a>&gt;) with thoughts or
questions.
